# JumLang-Swift

This is a version of [JumLang](https://github.com/Jumhyn/JumLang) written in Swift. This will be the main repository
from now on. JumLang is still very much in flux, so everything (everything!) is subject to change. JumTest.jum contains
an example of what JumLang looks like, and a formal grammar is on the way.
